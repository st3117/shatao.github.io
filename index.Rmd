I'm a second-year graduate student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) major in Biostatistics. Currently I'm doing research on topic [cognitive reserve](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/what-is-cognitive-reserve) in Alzheimer's disease, and performing neuro-image data analysis at [New York State Psychiatric Institute](https://nyspi.org/).

I graduated from [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) with a BS in biochemisty and molucular biology in 2016. I've studied plant gene RHD3 for years.

I'd like to be a data scientist?!
